## Autonomous Research Agent

### Study Notes: Building a Full Agent

#### Key Components:
1. **Routing**: 
   - Add decision-making capabilities to route requests to multiple tools.

2. **Tool Use**: 
   - Create an interface for agents to interact with selected tools.
   - Generate appropriate arguments for the chosen tools.

3. **Multi-Step Reasoning with Tool Use**: 
   - Use LLMs (Language Learning Models) for multi-step reasoning.
   - Retain memory throughout the process.

#### Key Objectives:
- **Effective Interaction with an Agent**:
  - Utilize the agent's capabilities for detailed control and oversight.
  - Develop a higher-level research assistant over RAG (Retrieve and Generate) pipelines.
  - Guide the agent's actions more effectively.

- **Debugging the LLM**:
  - Ensure the agent's actions are transparent and debug-able.
  - Learn to step through the agentâ€™s processes to identify and implement improvements.

- **Injecting Guidance**:
  - Allow user input to guide the agent at intermediate steps.
  - Example: Redirecting a document search based on user feedback.
