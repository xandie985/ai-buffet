      " Templates for Chat Models Introduction An increasingly common use case for LLMs is chat. In a chat context, rather than continuing a single string\n",
      "of text (as is the case with a standard language model), the model instead continues a conversation that consists\n",
      "of one or more messages, each of which includes a role, like “user” or “assistant”, as well as message text. Much like tokenization, different models expect very different input formats for chat. This is the reason we added\n",
      "chat templates as a feature. Chat templates are part of the tokenizer. They specify how to convert conversations,\n",
      "represented as lists of messages, into a single tokenizable string in the format that the model expects. Let’s make this concrete with a quick example using the BlenderBot model. BlenderBot has an extremely simple default\n",
      "template, which mostly just adds whitespace between rounds of dialogue: Copied >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n",
      ">>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill\")\n",
      ">>> chat = [\n",
      "... {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, how are you?\"},\n",
      "... {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"I'm doing great. How can I help you today?\"},\n",
      "... {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"I'd like to show off how chat templating works!\"},\n",
      "... ]\n",
      ">>> tokenizer.apply_chat_template(chat, tokenize=False)\n",
      "\" Hello, how are you? I'm doing great. How can I help you today? I'd like to show off how chat templating works!</s>\" Notice how the entire chat is condensed into a single string. If we use tokenize=True, which is the default setting,\n",
      "that string will also be tokenized for us. To see a more complex template in action, though, let’s use the\n",
      "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model. Copied >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n",
      ">>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1\")\n",

      "user messages (but not assistant messages!). Mistral-instruct was trained with these tokens, but BlenderBot was not. How do I use chat templates? As you can see in the example above, chat templates are easy to use. Simply build a list of messages, with role\n",
      "and content keys, and then pass it to the apply_chat_template() method. Once you do that,\n",
      "you’ll get output that’s ready to go! When using chat templates as input for model generation, it’s also a good idea\n",
      "to use add_generation_prompt=True to add a generation prompt. Here’s an example of preparing input for model.generate(), using the Zephyr assistant model: Copied from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n",

      "strings, lists, dicts or whatever else you want. That said, there are some common use-cases for these extra arguments,\n",
      "such as passing tools for function calling, or documents for retrieval-augmented generation. In these common cases,\n",
      "we have some opinionated recommendations about what the names and formats of these arguments should be, which are\n",
      "described in the sections below. We encourage model authors to make their chat templates compatible with this format,\n",
      "to make it easy to transfer tool-calling code between models. Advanced: Tool use / function calling “Tool use” LLMs can choose to call functions as external tools before generating an answer. When passing tools\n",
      "to a tool-use model, you can simply pass a list of functions to the tools argument: Copied import datetime\n",

      "correctly as tools. Specifically, you should follow these rules: The function should have a descriptive name Every argument must have a type hint The function must have a docstring in the standard Google style (in other words, an initial function description\n",
      "followed by an Args: block that describes the arguments, unless the function does not have any arguments. Do not include types in the Args: block. In other words, write a: The first number to multiply, not\n",
      "a (int): The first number to multiply. Type hints should go in the function header instead. The function can have a return type and a Returns: block in the docstring. However, these are optional\n",
      "because most tool-use models ignore them. Passing tool results to the model The sample code above is enough to list the available tools for your model, but what happens if it wants to actually use\n",

      "1. Training: One example of using chat templates in training could involve creating a dataset of pre-defined chat templates with different intents such as greetings, inquiries, or farewells. These templates can be used to train a chatbot model on how to respond appropriately based on the intent of the user's input.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Tool Use/Function Calling: In the context of tool use or function calling, chat templates can be utilized to streamline the process of invoking specific tools or functions within a chatbot environment. For instance, a chat template could be designed to trigger a specific action or tool based on user input, making the interaction more efficient and user-friendly.\n",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation: When it comes to retrieval-augmented generation, chat templates can be used to enhance the generation process by providing pre-existing responses or information that can be retrieved and incorporated into the chatbot's output. This can help improve the quality and relevance of the generated responses, making the conversation more engaging and informative for the user.\n",

      "Dear Andrew Ng,\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for reaching out with your questions regarding chat templates, automated pipelines, and template writing tips. I have gathered detailed information from the HuggingFace website to provide you with the best support possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Using Chat Templates:\n",
      "Chat templates play a crucial role in converting conversations into a format that chat models can understand. To utilize chat templates effectively, you can create a list of messages with role and content keys and then apply them using the apply_chat_template() method. This method facilitates formatting conversations for model input and generating output that is ready for use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Automated Pipelines for Chat:\n",
      "Indeed, there are automated pipelines available for chat inputs, simplifying the process of using chat models. The TextGenerationPipeline class is designed to handle both chat templates and model generation. By initializing the pipeline and providing a list of messages, the pipeline takes care of tasks such as tokenization and template application, streamlining the workflow for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Template Writing Tips:\n",
      "When crafting chat templates, it is essential to adhere to Jinja template syntax and implement best practices. To ensure optimal performance, remember to eliminate unnecessary whitespace, utilize for loops and if statements effectively, and make use of special variables like bos_token and eos_token for precise formatting. Additionally, consider compatibility with non-Python Jinja implementations by employing Jinja filters and standard syntax.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more in-depth examples on leveraging chat templates in various scenarios such as training, tool use/function calling, and retrieval-augmented generation, as well as advanced tips on tool schemas and template editing, I recommend referring to the comprehensive content available on the HuggingFace website.\n",
